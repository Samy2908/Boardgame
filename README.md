This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for deploying a microservice-based application in Kubernetes, using industry-standard DevOps tools and practices. The pipeline is fully automated and integrates with GitHub for source code version control, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

Key stages include Maven for build and test automation, SonarQube for code quality analysis, and Trivy for vulnerability scanning of Docker images. The Dockerized application is stored in Nexus repository before being securely deployed to Kubernetes, with additional security scanning by Kubeaudit. Continuous monitoring and alerting are handled by Prometheus and Grafana, ensuring robust application performance and security insights.

This project showcases modern DevOps practices like infrastructure-as-code (IaC), security integration (DevSecOps), and continuous monitoring, making it highly scalable and production-ready. It reflects my expertise in streamlining software delivery processes while ensuring code quality, security, and operational efficiency.

## Main Features

1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins
   - Automated pipeline built with Jenkins to manage the complete software development lifecycle, 
     from code commit to deployment.
  
2. Maven Build and Testing
   - Automated build and test process using Maven to ensure code quality and functionality before 
     deployment.
    
3. Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube
   - Static code analysis performed by SonarQube to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, 
     ensuring high-quality code.
  
4. Container Image Scanning with Trivy
   - Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities to enhance security before pushing them to the 
      registry.

5. Artifact Management with Nexus Repository
   - Maven-generated artifacts are stored and managed in Nexus Repository, ensuring a centralized, 
     version-controlled storage.

6. Dockerized Application Deployment to Kubernetes
   - Fully Dockerized application is built, tagged, and pushed to Docker Hub, followed by deployment 
     to a Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration.
  
7. Kubernetes Security Scanning with Kubeaudit
   - Kubeaudit scans the Kubernetes deployment for potential security issues and provides         
     recommendations to enhance the security of the environment.

8. Prometheus and Grafana for Monitoring
   - Prometheus monitors system performance and resource usage, while Grafana provides real-time 
     visualization and alerts for the applicationâ€™s health.

9. Email Notifications for Pipeline Events
   -  Configured Jenkins to send email alerts for successful or failed pipeline stages, ensuring 
      real-time status updates.

10. Scalable and Secure Infrastructure
    - The project incorporates scalable Kubernetes architecture and security best practices, 
      ensuring a production-ready deployment environment.

## Technologies Used

* Jenkins: For automating the CI/CD pipeline, handling tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the application.

* Maven: Used to automate the build process, manage dependencies, and execute unit tests.

* SonarQube: For performing static code analysis to ensure the code is free from bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

* Trivy: A security scanner that checks Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing them to a registry.

* Nexus Repository: A repository manager used to store and version control Maven-generated artifacts and Docker images.

* Docker: For containerizing the application, enabling it to run consistently across different environments.

* Kubernetes: Used to deploy, manage, and scale the Dockerized application in a cluster environment.

* Prometheus: Provides real-time monitoring and alerting for application and infrastructure metrics.

* Grafana: Used for creating dashboards to visualize metrics from Prometheus and send alerts based on performance or health thresholds.

* GitHub: Acts as the source code repository and triggers Jenkins when code is committed or pushed.
